### Part 1 — Imaging Technique Inspiration 

- I initially considered employing the *“Photomontage”* technique, assembling multiple images into a cohesive work. However, due to complexity concerns, I ultimately opted for *”Halftone Imaging“*. This technology simulates continuous-tone images by using dots of varying sizes or spacing, thereby producing gradient-like effects. This approach draws inspiration from newspaper printing, where dot-based reconstruction of light and dark tones could effectively recreates our selected artworks through code generation. Composed of dots, each arranged differently, it seamlessly demonstrates the artwork while enabling natural transitions in color and light.

### Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

- They are all based on **Pixel Array Sampling**, which converts continuous-tone images into halftone effects composed of dots by accessing and analyzing the image's brightness data, ultimately forming a complete picture.

- I also consulted two additional links, but they were slightly beyond my current understanding, so I didn't fully grasp the entire process. However, it's evident that halftone imaging technology can also produce color images.
